# UT_R_2023_SGSC

# Automating Table 1 and Figure 1 in R

Software: R, RStudio, SublimeText (recommended for a cleaner coding environment)

Main packages: 
Graphs  - ggplot2   (cheat sheet: https://statsandr.com/blog/files/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) /
Tables  - gtsummary (overview: https://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/ ) /
          flextable (cheat sheet: https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/static/pdf/cheat_sheet_flextable.pdf)/

Sample data: ACS from IPUM (Using IPUM with R is another struggle and we won't have the time to talk about it.) 

Recommendation: Bring a small sample of data from the project you are working on. In this workshop, choose 3-5 variables with numeric, binary, and categorical variables to practice making tables and figures. If your data requires weighting, please also bring the weight variables (if it is incredibly complicated... I can't promise you a perfect result in the workshop, but at least something to start with). 

To ensure our practice runs as smoothly as possible, please try loading your sample data in R and properly label them, so they're table- and graph-ready (ex: Yes or No, instead of 1 and 0). You can take a look at Amanda's workshop materials for data-wrangling commands. 

If you work with restricted or mysterious data and are unable to share it, you can use the sample data I prepared. It may not be as helpful for your specific goals, but it could still be fun.
